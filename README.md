# i75DeeLux
Little framework to give some fun functionality ease the use of having fun with hub75 displays and the pimoroni i75. May try to make an esp port as well. 

This is non functional in the current state. I got a little youtube sub counter showing up on my hub75 display and thought it would be cool to expand the features. 
I started looking at some weather apis and other stuff. Before long I just decided to stub out how things may work or connect logically. I'll be working more on this and getting something going. 
I wanted to put it here as a reminder to do so. Also, maybe eventually it can be useful to others.
